# GOV.UK Ask Export

A tool for working with the data of the Smart Survey that powers
https://www.gov.uk/ask. This downloads data from Smart Survey and splits it into
CSV files.

## How to use

### Setup

Install dependencies with `bundle install`

### Run tests

```
bundle exec rake
```

This will lint and test the code.

### Daily Google Drive export

The daily export process is designed to be run once a day after 10am (London
time) from a scheduled task. This is not currently set-up.

The task can be run with:

```
bundle exec rake drive_export
```

The following environment variables should be configured:

- `SMART_SURVEY_LIVE` (optional) - set this to `"true"` to access the live survey,
  otherwise the draft one will be used.
- `SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN` - accessible via Smart Survey in Account > API Keys
- `SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_TYPE` - expected to be `"service_account"`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - this and following Google fields are populated with
  service account user credentials downloadable from the Google Cloud Platform
  Console
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `NOTIFY_API_KEY` - API key for the GOV.UK Notify service to inform recipients
  files are ready
- `CABINET_OFFICE_DRIVE_FOLDER` - the file id of the Google Drive folder for
  storing Cabinet Office's CSV exports
- `CABINET_OFFICE_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` - a comma separated list of email addresses
  of colleagues at the cabinet office who will be emailed upon a successful export
- `DATA_LABS_DRIVE_FOLDER` - the file id of the Google Drive folder for
  storing Data Labs' CSV exports
- `DATA_LABS_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` - a comma separated list of email addresses
  of colleagues in the Data Labs team who will be emailed upon a successful export
- `PERFORMANCE_ANALYST_DRIVE_FOLDER` - the file id of the Google Drive folder for
  storing CSV exports for performance analysis
- `PERFORMANCE_ANALYST_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` - a comma separated list of email addresses
  of performance analysts who will be emailed upon a successful export
- `THIRD_PARTY_DRIVE_FOLDER` - the file id of the Google Drive folder for
  storing CSV exports for the third party
- `THIRD_PARTY_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` - a comma separated list of email addresses
  of third party colleagues who will be emailed upon a successful export
- `SECRET_KEY` - a key that is used as salt to hashing functions to anonymise
  personally identifiable information
- `SINCE_TIME` (optional) - defaults to "10:00", can be changed to alter the time
  exports include data from. When this is a relative time (for example "10:00") it
  will be for the previous day, otherwise an absolute time can be set (for example
  "2020-05-01 10:00") for a precise data export
- `UNTIL_TIME` (optional) - defaults to "10:00", can be changed to alter the time
  exports include data until. When this is a relative time (for example "10:00") it
  will be for the current day, otherwise an absolute time can be set (for example
  "2020-05-01 10:00") for a precise data export

### Manual export

If the daily export cannot be run or fails we have a manual process that can
be run on a local machine to generate the CSV files. This can also be used
to handle requests for ad-hoc time periods.

You'll need the API token and API Token Secret for Smart Survey which can be
found in the Account > API Keys section.

You can test a draft export with:

```
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 64) SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN=<api-token> SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN_SECRET=<api-token-secret> bundle exec rake file_export
```

There should now be files created in the `output` directory of this project
that can be shared.

You can specify the time range the export should run from and until with the
`SINCE_TIME` and `UNTIL_TIME` environment variables. It is recommended you
use ISO 8601 formatting such as "2020-05-01 10:00" or "10:00"

For example:

```
SINCE_TIME=09:00 UNTIL_TIME=11:00 SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 64) SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN=<api-token> SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN_SECRET=<api-token-secret> bundle exec rake file_export
```

To perform the live export you need `SMART_SURVEY_LIVE` to equal `"true"`, for
example:

```
SMART_SURVEY_LIVE=true SINCE_TIME=09:00 UNTIL_TIME=11:00 SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 64) SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN=<api-token> SMART_SURVEY_API_TOKEN_SECRET=<api-token-secret> bundle exec rake file_export
```

This should now have added files to the `output` directory (it will have
overwritten any draft files).

These examples all use a randomly generated secret key to hash user identifiable
information for Data Labs. Using this randomly generated key means these hashes
will change each run and not allowing comparing hashes between runs. To maintain
the same hashes as the daily export run you will want to retrieve the secret
key used in the daily export. This can be retrieved from the concourse pipeline
with `gds cd secrets get cd-govuk-tools govuk-ask-export/secret-key`.
